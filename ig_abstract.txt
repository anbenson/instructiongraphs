A Domain-Specific Programming Language for Robots based on Instruction Graphs

Instruction graphs are a recently proposed data structure that encodes a
sequence of actions for a robot to perform. For example, in order for a robot to
purchase coffee, a robot might move forward, looking for a barista every 5
meters, then ask for a coffee once a barista is found. An instruction graph is
an explicit representation of these actions, where each action is a vertex and
edges are the transitions between them. We contribute a formalization of
instruction graphs as a domain-specific programming language, prove type safety
for the language, and provide an interpreter.
